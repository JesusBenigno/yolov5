## Pothole Detection in Indian Roads
--------------------------------------------------------------

For reliable and effective transportation networks, it is crucial to maintain the road infrastructure. One of the most prevalent types of road faults that can cause accidents, damage to vehicles, and traffic congestion are potholes. This study focuses on a proposal to create an automated system for accurately and quickly detecting potholes using object detection methods. This system analyzes real-time video footage taken by cameras mounted on cars or other roadside infrastructure using image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques like Roboflow and YOLO object detection algorithms. It then provides timely and accurate information to the relevant authorities in charge of road maintenance, enabling them to take proactive measures to fix potholes and ensure road safety.
